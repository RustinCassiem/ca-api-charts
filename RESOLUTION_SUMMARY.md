# Helm Charts Setup Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Chart Dependency Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: `gateway-otk` chart dependency version constraint `^1.0.0` didn't match actual version `2.0.3`
- **Solution**: Updated umbrella chart `Chart.yaml` to use `^2.0.0` version constraint

### 2. **Druid Chart Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Missing Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) configurations for all druid components
- **Solution**: Added `pdb` configuration blocks with `create: false` defaults for:
  - zookeeper, minio, middlemanager, broker, coordinator, historical, ingestion, kafka

### 3. **Chart Metadata Issues**
- **Problem**: Druid Chart.yaml had `appVersion: 31.0` as number instead of string
- **Solution**: Changed to `appVersion: "31.0"` (quoted string)

### 4. **Missing Umbrella Chart Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Root umbrella chart was missing druid as a dependency
- **Solution**: Added druid dependency to umbrella `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`

### 5. **CI/CD Chart-Releaser Issues**
- **Problem**: Chart-releaser failing due to missing external repositories during packaging
- **Solution**: 
  - Added helm repository setup in CI workflow
  - Updated Makefile to add repositories before dependency updates
  - Created chart-releaser configuration file (.cr.yaml)
  - Added comprehensive repository management

### 6. **Umbrella Chart Template Issues**
- **Problem**: Missing templates directory causing lint warnings
- **Solution**: 
  - Created templates directory with NOTES.txt
  - Added validation logic for component enablement
  - Fixed hyphenated key access in Helm templates
