# Helm Charts Setup Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Chart Dependency Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: `gateway-otk` chart dependency version constraint `^1.0.0` didn't match actual version `2.0.3`
- **Solution**: Updated umbrella chart `Chart.yaml` to use `^2.0.0` version constraint

### 2. **Druid Chart Configuration Issues**
- **Problem**: Missing Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) configurations for all druid components
- **Solution**: Added `pdb` configuration blocks with `create: false` defaults for:
  - zookeeper
  - minio
  - middlemanager
  - broker
  - coordinator
  - historical
  - ingestion
  - kafka

### 3. **Chart Metadata Issues**
- **Problem**: Druid Chart.yaml had `appVersion: 31.0` as number instead of string
- **Solution**: Changed to `appVersion: "31.0"` (quoted string)

### 4. **Missing Umbrella Chart Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Root umbrella chart was missing druid as a dependency
- **Solution**: Added druid dependency to umbrella `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`

### 5. **Enhanced Development Workflow**
- **Problem**: Basic Makefile commands were failing with license requirements
- **Solution**: Updated Makefile to handle CI values files and graceful error handling

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ **All charts pass linting**
